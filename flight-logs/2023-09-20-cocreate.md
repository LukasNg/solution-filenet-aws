## Work in Progress
- Today the team began to walk through an installation of Process Designer in the client's environment.
- The team ran into an error while trying to setup Process Designer in the Windows VM.
- There were some differences in the java versions. We were using the JDK and the client had the JRE. But after setting the JAVA_HOME, it looks like Process Designer was able to locate Java. However, Process Designer gave an error that it was unable to load "main class". 
## Currently Tracking
- We opened a ticket and the team is working with support to troubleshoot this error.
## Next Steps
- The team will continue to work on the installation of Process Designer in our next session.
