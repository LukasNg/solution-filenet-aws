## Work in Progress
- The team continued to walk through the installation of Process Designer in the client's environment.
- The team was able to resolve the previous sessionâ€™s startup error. When unpacking Process Designer, Windows added an additional folder that altered and made the file path incorrect. However, the team encountered a new authentication error while attempting to login.
## Currently Tracking
- The team updated the open ticket with this new issue and the team is working with support to troubleshoot this error.
## Next Steps
- The team will continue to work on the installation of Process Designer in our next session.
