## Key Accomplishments
- CPE was successfully bootstrapped and object store was created/initialized
- We were able to port forward to login to ACCE until dev team finds the root cause of Ingress errors.

## Challenges
- Ingress update: the IBM Development team is still working on getting this issue resolved.  This is the first time errors like this have come up, so they are going through logs to get to the root of the issue.

## Action Items

- In our meeting tomorrow, we will work on bootstrapping the Navigator.
