## Date
Flight Log contain information relating to steps completed on 06/01/2023

## Key Accomplishments
- Successfully edited CR with necessary attributes needed by CR to spin up the Navigator pods.
- We were able to successfully deploy Navigator and confirmed it was initialized and bootstrapped with port forwarding.
    - Accessed on https://localhost:9443/navigator

## Challenges
- Operator would not create Navigator pod after initially reapplying CR.
- There were errors pertaining to spinning up all Navigator pods.  Operator would create first pod but had resource issues in spinning up the second. After confirming the resources were set to their intended values,  we scaled the Navigator replicas down to 1 so the Operator would only make one Navigator pod, and this fixed the issue.

## Action Items
- IBM Dev team is still working on Ingress issue.  Once this is fixed, we can move forward to the next phase.
