## Date
Flight Logs contain information relating to steps completed between 03/19/24 - 03/21/24

## Key Accomplishments
- Client deleted the 'ingress-nginx' namespace instead of cleaning up resources. Shared steps on how to clean up resources if a namespace is stuck in terminating state. Documentation used - https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-private/3.2.x?topic=console-namespace-is-stuck-in-terminating-state#manually-delete-a-terminating-namespace

## Work In Progress 
- Working with support team to resolve IER deployment failure.

## Challenges
- **IER Image:** Client is getting Back off error message for IER pod. 

## Action Items
- Track the case TS015679454 and resolve the issue. 
- Look into s3 config without access keys - enhancement request was approved by product team last year. It improves content replication setup. 

## Next Steps 
- Client to run through the steps to Install NGINX Controller. 
- Look into the certificate setup and recommend next steps, including any other fields in the YAML that have to be filled. 
- Check if cert is now valid from ICN, etc. If so, reimport cert into keystore and retry launching PD. 
- Continuing to track the IER image pull issue support case. Deploy IBM Enterprise Record and TM pod setup for IER.
