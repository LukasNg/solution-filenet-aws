## Work in Progress
- The team continued with the installation of Process Designer in the customer's environment.
- In the previous session the team was encountering a authentication issue with Process Designer in the customer's environment. The team didn't make any changes to the customer's environment, but the authentication issue was no longer present. We took the logs back to the support team and await their feedback on the situation. 
- The team then began a walk-through of some of the functionality of Process Designer.
## Currently Tracking
- The team plans to continue the Process Designer walk-through in the next session.
- The team received the logs from todayâ€™s session. We will work with support and get their feedback.
## Next Steps
- The team will continue the walk-through of Process Designer then move to other use cases and demos.
