# Deployment of FileNet

In this section we will delve into the various components that need to be deployed to both support the FNCM Operator as well as the applications the FNCM Operator will deploy.

## 1. [OpenLDAP](/Create/Deploy/solution-deploy-openldap)

For the purposes of this example deployment we will be using OpenLDAP to host our users and groups. The linked document goes into deeper details.

## 2. [PostgresQL](/Create/Deploy/solution-deploy-postgres)

Our database of choice for this example deployment is Postgresql. FileNet currently supports the following databases:

- Postgres
- DB2

## 3. [Operator](/Create/Deploy/solution-deploy-operator)

This is the FNCM Operator. It is similar to the CP4A operator. The above linked document will take you through deploying and creating an appropriate Custom Resource file to apply for deploying the applications for FileNet.

## 4. [IBM Enterprise Records](/Create/Deploy/solution-deploy-ier)

IBM Enterprise Records is an optional add-on that is not part of a default deployment of FileNet. Follow the linked document if you require IBM Enterprise Records in your environment.
