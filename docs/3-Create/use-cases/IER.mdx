# IER UseCases

## Create an electronic record 

In IER desktop Navigate to FPOS and create a fileplan as shown in below example 

![FilePlan](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/cca92475-17d7-4ba7-8cfe-b097fcd75200)

Navigate to ICN desktop > ROS and select a document you want to declare as record 

![Record](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/932ff6cd-5b60-4c83-8002-b6e188af883e)


Select the file plan repository as FPOS and preoperties as shown below.Click on _Declare_

![DeclareRecord](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/15cdb8c6-365e-4ac8-93e1-c9990820aa31)

Now the seected document will have an icon as shown like below 

![RecordIcon](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/d6fcf4d7-fc75-4010-8f4f-74cf4961ac52)

IN IER desktop selcetd record on above steps would be visible as Electronic Record

## Managing Records


### Creating Dispostion Schedule

There are two distinct types of disposition schedules available for your use.Basic dispostion schedule and Advanced dispostion schedule.

A basic dispostion schedule is a record category that specifies the retention period and the retention trigger property (event).
The value of using a Basic disposition schedule is faster time to process dispositions and less complexity in defining the schedule specifics.


An Advanced disposition schedule contains the retention period, the cut off trigger event (when the clock starts ticking), record phases and disposal instructions.
An administrator can associate a disposition schedule with one or more record categories, record folders or record types.
A record folder can have its own disposition schedule, or it can inherit the disposition schedule associated with a parent record category.


In a disposition schedule, an administrator will specify the retention rules for records and instructions for disposing of records at the end of the retention period.
 Disposition instructions and workflows include -

• Review

• Transfer to an archive for permanent preservation

• Export to another location

• Destroy (with approval)

• Auto-destroy

Below are the steps how to create a dispostion schedule.

1. Navigate to IER desktop and click on Configuration Tab. Select _Advanced Dispostion Schedules_ from dropdown as shown below.


![Dispostion](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/39827486-20a0-4584-a0ce-5eef86065f83)


2. Click _Add Dispostion Schedule_ to create a new dispostion schedule 


![AddDispostion](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/d89728ab-3e1e-40be-9e62-6b89d06bd33c)


3. Now we need to enter the properties for the dispostion schedule as shown below example 


![DispostionProp](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/59b49906-74de-4d6e-8262-a2913bc0033f)


4. Scroll down on dispostion schedule page.You can see the _Contract dispostion_ added like below


![DispostionSchedule](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/a7cdeb64-4e1a-4ff3-abf6-20a621b3fc22)

5. A new dispostion schedule is scuessfully added to the list 



### Applying and executing disposition schedule

Disposition is normally executed on an automated schedule basis. There may be times that, as a Records Administrator, you would want to apply and execute a disposition schedule manually.
Although this is not the most common mechanism for executing a disposition schedule, it can be done if the need arises. 

1. Click on the top navigator icon on left corner and navigate to _File Plans_


![FilePlan](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/d20f11e4-66cf-4811-8e88-78f189dab931)


2. Navigate to record category and clcik _Add Record Category_ . Below is a screenshot for reference.

![RecordCategory](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/77320014-36ea-4fa3-a051-d853fdc12e43)


3. Fill in recordcategory properties as shown in below example and click _Add_ button

![RecordProp](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/691b190a-7a61-4adf-abdf-73aff3ba10b4)


4. Now the records category with DateCreated is visible .Below is a refrence screenshot.

![DispostionInstruction](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/79cc265e-25b7-4be9-afd2-571eeb7aff85)

5. Re-classify previous manually declared record to new Record category.Below is an example to refer.

![Classifyrecord](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/14e93a1b-a4bf-4f46-93aa-0055b36700ff)

Select _Move_ and enter _2023 Compliance Rule_ and the new record category . Click _Move_ . Below is a screenshot to refer.

![MoveRecord](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/d61b1f41-946f-4315-ba19-1fd8a3e69e86)

Below is what you will see as an example under record category

![RecordMoved](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/26e81b8c-e718-41f9-9e7d-6c6eb1e6a381)


6. Now we can run the dispostion sweep to prepare above record gategory for dispostion. 

      On top left Navigator click on _Tasks_ and Click on Schedule > Schedule Basic Dispostion Sweep and shown below


![DispostionSweep](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/9bb0887a-292e-4aa3-a16f-1612f3812b67)


Select FPOS and fill in details as shown in refrence screenshot and Schedule Sweep


![FPOS](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/4e3ff62b-08a5-40da-98a8-18f727e19ac0)


![ScheduleSweep](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-filenet-aws/assets/136734452/cd7c19e6-7fa3-4200-955f-71bd6ace6e0e)

You will see the scheduled sweep with a Status of Scheduled. Click Refresh until you see it shows Completed.
