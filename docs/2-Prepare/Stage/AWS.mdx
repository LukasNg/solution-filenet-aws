## Set Up AWS Account

- CMDLINE Client install (MacOS)

Download the client

```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
```

Install it with sudo (to use for all users)

```
sudo installer -pkg ./AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
```

Now let's configure our client env

```
aws configure
```

Answer all the questions with the info you got. If you already have a profile configured, you can add a named profile to your credentials

```tsx
vi ~/.aws/credentials

[default]
aws_access_key_id =
aws_secret_access_key =

[748107796891_AWSAdmin]
aws_access_key_id=
aws_secret_access_key=
```

Also add location info to the config file

```tsx
vi ~/.aws/config

[default]
region = us-east-1
output = json

[profile techzone_user]
region=us-east-1
output=json
```

We are also going to use some env magic to make sure we stick with the second profile

```
export AWS_PROFILE=748107796891_AWSAdmin
```

You may also copy the following out of the aws portal and paste it into your shell

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
```
