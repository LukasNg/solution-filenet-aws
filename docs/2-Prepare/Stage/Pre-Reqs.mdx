## Cluster Sizing

### Small (targets development)

|Component |CPU Request (m)|CPU Limit (m)|Memory Request (Mi)|Memory Limit (Mi)|Number of replicas|

We are going with MEDIUM, so technically we only need 12 vcpus and 24 gigs RAM. We are going to provision a 6 node cluster with the `m5.xlarge` sizing as this will give us 24 vcpu and 96 gigs RAM, which is way more than we need anyway. Man, if there was only a sizing in AWS that was 4 VCPU/8 GIGS, that would be ideal as we're going to have twice as many vpcus and 4 times as much RAM as we need.
