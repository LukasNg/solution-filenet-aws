## Date
Flight Log contain information relating to steps completed on 06/09/2023

## Key Accomplishments
* We had a working session with the IBM Dev team to show them the issues we are experiencing.  
* We decided to go back to using NGINX and validated the secret and certificate were created successfully.

## Challenges
* We were still experiencing the same issues, so we set up tracelogs for the Ingress and exported these logs for further review.


## Action Items
* We are going to let the IBM Dev team review the logs from today to see if there is any lead on what the issue could be.
